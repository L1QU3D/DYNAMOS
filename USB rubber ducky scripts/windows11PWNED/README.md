### To use this ducky script:
you will need to replace;

- [REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS], 
- [USERNAME], and 
- [PASSWORD] 

with the IP address of the remote system, your username on the remote system, and your password, respectively.

    - The script first opens the Run dialog (by pressing the Windows key and "r"), 
    - then opens the Remote Desktop Connection application (mstsc) and connects to the specified IP address. 
    - It then enters your username and password, and clicks the "Connect" button to initiate the connection.

This script will allow you to remotely access the Windows 11 system from another computer. Note that you will need to have permission to access the remote system, and that the Remote Desktop feature must be enabled on the remote system in order for this script to work.
